# Professional Overview
Hello! My name is Evan and I am currently an undergraduate student at Texas A&M University studying for my Bachelor of Arts in Computing with a Concentration in Software Entrepreneurship. At the core of my studies are everything you would expect to find for a university level computer science program. This is then complemented by my concentration area where I have taken many electives on business leadership, enterprise fundamentals, and product design. My education is specially tailored to fit a wide variety of industry environments from small startups to the large corporate world.

I have been very fortunate to learn from some of the best computer scientists and some of the best business leaders in the world through first hand experiences. The past couple of years have been a time where I have grown immensly in my career and I'm excited to say that I am just getting started. I can't wait to see where I go next; the future is exciting!

## GeoCash: 2018 - 2020

This was very much a humble beginning. The idea for GeoCash was to be a mobile game similar to the real Geocaching but where people would earn money for following hints to a real world location. Think of it as a scavenger hunt for money. I was proud of it at the time but now that I'm looking back, I can see that I did just about everything wrong. The UI design was horrible, my code was terribly engineered, and most of all, the product couldn't be distributed anywhere. I only knew native Android development and it wouldn't even be approved by the Google Play store because the business model was considered gambling. I had to settle for putting it on third party APK websites where I seriously thought it could grow that way.

The next project I worked on was Eagle - an app for finding fun stops along the way on road trips. I grew up taking a lot of road trips with my family and really enjoyed them; that was the inspiration for this app. Users would enter in some keywords to describe what they were interested in and a backend service I created would calculate a search area along the route and find some interesting stops that fit that search criteria. Users could then add and remove points of interest to effectively plan their journey. There was also the option for users to share the trips they planned on social media to grow the user base. This one had more charm and it's something that may be fun to revisit in the future if I can come up with a good business model for it.
