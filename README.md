Hello!

My name is Evan and I'm a recent graduate of Texas A&M University. I earned my Bachelor of Arts in Computing with a concentration area of Engineering Entrepreneurship. Currently, I develop software solutions for the rural energy and broadband industries through writing code for the generation of accurate and intuitive PDF bills.

# Major Projects

## GeoCash/SearchX: 2018 - 2022

</div>

As my first large software engineering project, GeoCash was intended to be a scavenger hunt where users could earn money by locating different geographical points using a series of hints. I would later revisit GeoCash and rebrand it as SearchX by removing the monetary aspects and switching to a freemium model.

Tech Stack: Java, SQL, Flutter, Stripe API, Google Maps SDK, AWS, Firebase

## Eagle: 2020 - 2021

</div>

Built around my love for travel, Eagle was an app where users could plan a road trip by typing in their interests and getting a list of things to do along the route. Users could then share their road trips using features implemented with the Snapchat SDK.

Tech Stack: Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Google Maps SDK, Snapchat SDK, Firebase

## Coatails: 2022 - 2024

</div>

Coatails was a networking app designed with a focus on making in-person connections. Users could connect with each other by scanning a QR code and then view a graph to see who their connections know. The aspect of connecting on an "in-person only" basis was intended to promote stronger connections by focusing on people users actually know.

Tech Stack: Flutter, Node.js, Firebase

## RecipeRocal: 2024

</div>

For my senior capstone project, my team built RecipeRocal - an app that gamifies nutrition by challenging users to reach goals. I served as my team's CI/CD lead and developed many different automations that kept the team working efficiently.

Tech Stack: JavaScript, React Native, Firebase, GitHub Actions

## ResuTailor: 2024

</div>

Resutailor is a self-hosted web application that makes it easy to optimize resumes for ATS. Users can provide a link to any job posting and select the skills from that posting that they have. Resutailor will then automatically insert those skills into the user's resume as they appear in the job posting.
