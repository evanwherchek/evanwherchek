# Professional Overview
Hello! My name is Evan and I am currently an undergraduate student at Texas A&M University studying for my Bachelor of Arts in Computing with a Concentration in Software Entrepreneurship. At the core of my studies is everything you would expect to find for a university-level computer science program. This is then complemented by my concentration area where I have taken many electives on business leadership, enterprise fundamentals, and product design. My education is specially tailored to fit a wide variety of industry environments from small startups to the large corporate world.

I have been very fortunate to learn from some of the best computer scientists and some of the best business leaders in the world through first-hand experiences. The past couple of years have been a time where I have grown immensely in my career and I'm excited to say that I am just getting started. I can't wait to see where I go next; the future is exciting!

# Major Projects
These are the major personal projects I have worked on over the past few years in chronological order along with my thoughts on them. If you are a recruiter and want to see the actual code for them, the repositories are available upon request.

## GeoCash: 2018 - 2020

This was very much a humble beginning. The idea for GeoCash was to be a mobile game similar to actual Geocaching but where people would earn money for following hints to a real-world location. Think of it as a scavenger hunt for money. I was proud of it at the time but now that I'm looking back, I can see that I did just about everything wrong. The UI design was horrible, my code was terribly engineered, and most of all, the product couldn't be distributed anywhere. I only knew native Android development and it wouldn't even be approved by the Google Play store because the business model was considered gambling. I had to settle for putting it on third-party APK websites where I seriously thought it could grow that way.

## Eagle: 2020 - 2021

The next project I worked on was Eagle - an app for finding fun stops along the way on road trips. I grew up taking a lot of road trips with my family and really enjoyed them; that was the inspiration for this app. Users would enter in some keywords to describe what they were interested in and a backend service I created would calculate a search area along the route and find some interesting stops that fit that search criteria. Users could then add and remove points of interest to effectively plan their journey. There was also the option for users to share the trips they planned on social media to grow the user base. This one had more charm and it's something that may be fun to revisit in the future if I can come up with a good business model for it.

Some time had passed since I worked on GeoCash and I thought it deserved a second chance. I had gained new skills and felt that I could apply my new knowledge to make it better. The biggest of these new skills that I learned was Flutter so now I could develop the app for iOS and actually get it to everyone. GeoCash became SearchX and had a fresh new design. The confusing monetary elements were gone and the UI was cleaned up a little. It was now a pure scavenger hunt game with a freemium subscription model to generate revenue. These changes were in the right direction. That being said, it was missing one thing: it was just a novelty and users didn't really get anything useful from it. This issue was the biggest driving factor in my next project.

## Coatails: 2022 - Present

Coatails is my current project that I work on and it's the most sophisticated thing I've done to date. It's an app dedicated to making professional networking more than just simple friend requests online. To connect with someone, users have to meet their new connection in real life first and scan a QR code to connect(think Snapchat or Venmo). This is done because connecting in real life offers the chance for a conversation so users can really get to know their new contact and form a much better professional connection than they ever could online. Networks on Coatails are quality over quantity. The app also offers users a visual map to show who their connections know to facilitate career growth. Overall, Coatails is like if your contacts app was upgraded in just about every way. Users get a quicker exchange of information, more details on people, and a fantastic way to seek out new connections.
