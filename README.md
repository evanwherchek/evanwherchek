Hello!

My name is Evan and I'm a recent graduate of Texas A&M University. I earned my Bachelor of Arts in Computing with a concentration area of Software Entrepreneurship. My academic journey is deeply rooted in a profound love for software engineering, which forms the backbone of my computer science program.

I have been lucky enough to delve into a diverse range of subjects, from the intricacies of coding to the nuances of business leadership, enterprise fundamentals, and product design. This unique blend of studies is designed to equip me with the skills required to thrive in various industry environments, from dynamic startups to large corporate settings.

What truly fuels my passion for software engineering is the endless opportunity for innovation it offers. The thrill of solving complex problems and seeing my code come to life is unparalleled. I believe that software engineering is not just a discipline, but a craft that requires continuous learning and refinement.

I'm grateful for the opportunity to learn from some of the best computer scientists and business leaders. These experiences have immensely enriched my career growth over the past few years. And  I'm just getting started. I eagerly look forward to exploring new frontiers in software engineering and making my own contributions. The future is exciting!

# Major Projects
These are the major personal projects I have worked on over the past few years in chronological order along with my thoughts on them. If you are a recruiter and want to see the actual code for them, the repositories are available upon request.

## GeoCash: 2018 - 2020
<div align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/evanwherchek/professional-overview/assets/50429973/aa2c3d4e-f864-4790-ac46-738c1277d3c2" width="200">
</div>

This was very much a humble beginning. The idea for GeoCash was to be a mobile game similar to actual Geocaching but users would earn money for following hints to a real-world location. Think of it as a scavenger hunt for money. I was proud of it at the time but now that I'm looking back, I can see a lot of things that could have been better. I only knew native Android development and it wouldn't even be approved by the Google Play Store because the business model was considered gambling. I had to settle for putting it on third-party APK websites where it couldn't get any exposure. Desipite this, I still consider GeoCash important as the project was one of my first large endeavors as a software engineer.

## Eagle: 2020 - 2021
<div align="center">

</div>

The next project I worked on was Eagle - an app for finding fun stops along the way on road trips. I grew up taking a lot of road trips with my family and really enjoyed them; that was the inspiration for this app. Users would enter in some keywords to describe what they were interested in and a backend service I created would calculate a search area along the route and find some interesting stops that fit that search criteria. Users could then add and remove points of interest to effectively plan their journey. There was also the option for users to share the trips they planned on social media to grow the user base. This one had more charm and, knowing everything I know now, it's something that may be fun to revisit in the future!

## SearchX: 2021 - 2022

Some time had passed since I worked on GeoCash and I thought it deserved a second chance. I had gained new skills and felt that I could apply my new knowledge to make it better. The biggest of these new skills that I learned was Flutter so now I could develop the app for iOS and actually get it to everyone. GeoCash became SearchX and had a fresh new design. The confusing monetary elements were gone and the UI was cleaned up a little. It was now a pure scavenger hunt game with a freemium subscription model to generate revenue. These changes were in the right direction. That being said, it was missing one thing: it was just a novelty and users didn't really get much value from it. This issue was the biggest driving factor in my next project.

## Coatails: 2022 - Present

</div>

Coatails is my current project that I work on and it's the most sophisticated thing I've done to date. It's an app dedicated to making professional networking more than just simple friend requests online. To connect with someone, users have to meet their new connection in real life first and scan a QR code to connect(think Snapchat or Venmo). This is done because connecting in real life offers the chance for a conversation so users can really get to know their new contact and form a much better professional connection than they ever could online. Networks on Coatails are quality over quantity. The app also offers users a visual map to show who their connections know to facilitate career growth. Overall, Coatails is like if your contacts app was upgraded in every way. Users get a quicker exchange of information, more details on people, and a fantastic way to seek out new connections.
